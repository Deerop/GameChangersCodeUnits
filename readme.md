# Code Units for FTc Ultimate Game 2021 Season

In observance with the covid-19 holiday, our team will meet less frequently, so there are less chances to test code.

Here you will find pure java modules that can be developed separately and plugged into the real robot code when needed

## cv
Ring detector pipeline. Separates a vertical stack of rings into separate shapes

## pathgen
Clever, remarkably simple but powerful point based iterative optimizer for robot paths. Define control points and the solver will find the fastest path through them.

Comes with UI and exporter

## odometry
Specify the location of as many odometry wheels as  you want and the algorithm will work out the overall robot translation and rotation
